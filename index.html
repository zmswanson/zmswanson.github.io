    <h1>STM32 Bluepill: Lessons Learned</h1>
    <p>My knockoff ST-Link V2 is broken. I should throw it away but I can't bring myself to throw away electronics.</p>
    <p>I'm able to use one of my other STM32 development boards with embedded STLINK programmer to program the Bluepill. I have to remove both CN2 jumpers and connect CN4 header to Bluepill SWD header.</p>
    <p>I have to press the reset button on the other STM32 dev board, not the Bulepill, to successfully program the Bluepill</p>
    <p>When working with System Workbench for STM32, I had to change the Run/Debug configuration "Reset Mode" option to "Software system restart".</p>
    <p>I've been doing this work using System Workbench for STM32 on Macbook Pro and I like to use the Standard Peripheral Library, which led to issues when trying to download the target firmwares. The solution was to modify the file "Applications/AC6/SystemWorkbench.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins/fr.ac6.mcu.ide_2.9.0.201904120827/resources/board_def/stm32targets.xml" to include a new server <url>https://www.st.com/resource/en/firmware2/</url> under <servers> near the top of the file. This url was found in a HTTP redirect message via WireShark that the download function obviously doesn't handle well.</p>
    <p>STM32 Bluepill boot pin jumpers: If you are using SWD for programming, then Boot 0 = 0 and Boot 1 = 0 (this directly programs flash memory). If you are using USART1 for programming, then Boot 0 = 1 and Boot 1 = 0 (loads the bootloader on boot enabling programming via USART). For whatever reason, it took a lot of google searches to find a clear answer on that. Even then I had to reference the manual to really understand.</p>
