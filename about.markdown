Hey everyone! Welcome to my blog. This is a space that I hope to share projects and lessons learned
as I find time to work and explore ideas.

I was born-and-raised in Nebraska and am still proud to call it home. I grew up farming with my
family in Eastern Nebraska which led to a lifelong passion for agriculture and all the technologies
that farmers and ranchers use everyday.

I studied Physics at Doane College and graduated in 2016. I finished my electrical engineering
degree in 2018 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

I spent five years in industry working as power systems engineer (never found a passion there), a
cybersecurity engineer for a startup reverse engineering and exploiting embedded systems, and
finally an electrical engineer working on embedded systems for an ag manufacturing company building
mechanized irrigation systems.

I had a lot of fun in industry and learned a LOT but wanted to deep dive into emerging technologies.
The See and Spray technology that started at Blue River Technology (now a subsidiary of John Deere)
and other vision-based solutions in agriculture had captivated my attention since my days at UNL.

In 2021, I trained and submitted a semantic segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture which
classified nine classes of aerial crop image objects for the Agriculture Vision competition. I got
dead last (hey it was close and it was my first attempt at deep learning and computer vision 
and I was going up against full teams) but had a blast and kept exploring computer vision 
technologies with my friend Graham as we built quadcopters with Nvidia companion computers and
stereo cameras for personal exploration and for simple enjoyment.

This year I finally decided to jump back into school. As of January 2024 I’m pursuing a master's in
electrical engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln working with Dr. Riggan’s team
conducting computer vision research. Hopefully I will have some fun and insightful posts from time
in graduate school.

Thanks for checking out my site!
